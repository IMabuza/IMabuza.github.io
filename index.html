            <center><h3> So why is Richard Hendrix Great?</h3></center>
            <p>Richard has gone through all kinds of hell and versions you can imagine for a young CEO trying to build his own start up. From the beginning he has to deal with a money hungry, evil CEO called Gavin Belson. Apart from his up and downs and battle with people richer than he, he had to also deal with his roommates who thought he is not a great CEO because of unco-ordinated personality. He says things like,"We are the bells of the balls on interviews!" lol, right?</p>

            <center><h3> Official Bio</h3></center>
              <p> Richard is a college dropout and coder at tech company Hooli, Richard quits his job to pursue his compression application Pied Piper. The company initially starts out as a simple data compression platform, but when this, and a videochat that Dinesh created with the algorithm fails, Richard pivots toward creating a new, decentralized internet, called PiperNet. For the most part, Richard is shy and weak-willed, and does not have much of a temper, but when he finally reaches his limit, is prone to intimidating explosions of anger. Richard is constantly struggling with the demands of the business world, preferring instead to disappear into the coding of his application, but realizes that as CEO he must do more.</p>
